# AscEmu
## Thanks and Credits

AscEmu is derived from ArcEmu, Ascent, Antrix, WowD Team. Many people worked
on the source and we appreciate the developers of the earlier projects.

For MoP (5.4.8) support (enter world, Pandaren, logout, packets, DB layout), parts of the implementation were referenced from [TrinityCore](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore) (GPL-2.0). See their [license](https://github.com/TrinityCore/TrinityCore/blob/3.3.5/LICENSE).

Thanks to everyone in the AscEmu community who helped us by discussing features,
submitting issues and all these awsome suggestions. You keep this project alive.
